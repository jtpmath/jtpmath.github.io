JTPmath solves problems in abstract mathematics and dicusses solutions online.  

My interest in abstract mathematics grew when I discovered linear algebra. I was stuck on the word "kernel" for about two years after that. I just couldn't wrap my head around why they called it a kernel, so I knew I had to keep investigating. 

Eventually I got to ring theory, where kernels began to make sense. It probably would have made even more sense if I would have seen group theory before linear algebra - or even at the same time - and then went on to rings, and then modules, and then vector spaces... actually, I should have just started with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyDvtSibCRwzW1gu5ADtc-8K0h29_iYac">abelian categories</a>. 

Eventually I went on to take advanced calculus. I didn't make the mistake of quitting, but I was stuck on the word "manifold." I didn't see the word manifold until a couple of years later when I finally got to graduate school. I should have just started with differential topology. 

Now I have this website, where I can start/end with whatever subject I want (independent of the choice of basepoint), and translate between whatever field I want (<a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Haar_measure">under a specific measure</a>), without someone lamenting "<a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/small+category">I only stay in this category!</a>" Now there is no box to constrain my thought process and no set to constrain yours!

But if you *had* to assign a label: my research interests are in analytic geometry, algebraic topology and complex analysis.
